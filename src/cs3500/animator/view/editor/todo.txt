removing first/last keyframe
editing view: Listeners can be tested by directly calling them, dont need to test the overall view
test the public stuff in the controller with commands etc

InteractiveViewTest and TestButtonListener

Issues

size of visual view panel still not showing up correctly/scrollbars
right now I have it to setPrefferedSize

stuff we should document
you can only edit while it is paused or not started
If a keyframe already exists at that time (when adding) the user will just
overwrite the existing keyframe
Adding a keyframe after the last time is allowed, just adds it like normal (same with adding a
keyframe
You can add a keyframe before the first keyframe of a shape, but you can't add a keyframe
at a negative time

optional stuff to add
option to save changes after editing (some type of output)
highlighting functionality - done



 having a new panel for highlighting shapes that extends visual view panel, calls to super and
 adds highlighting functionality, using that instead of the visualviewpanel
 maybe it could have a field for selected shape, and then when we select a shape in the view
 from a list of shapes, it sets the selected shape in the panel, and highlights that shape
